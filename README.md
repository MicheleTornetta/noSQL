## Installation Instructions
To install the application, you would download the readme-generator repository (https://github.com/MicheleTornetta/noSQL).  From there you would navigate to the directory in the command terminal.  Once there the user will need to type in npm i to download the dependencies. 

## Instructions
Once dependecies are dowloaded, open the terminal and type in node server and be sure MongoDB is open. The user should then open insomnia to search for one user, all users, add, change and delete users.
